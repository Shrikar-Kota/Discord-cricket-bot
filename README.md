<h1>Cricket Bot</h1>

This bot is written in python using the discord.py api wrapper module. This bot was made by me because of the interest I had in the game of cricket.

Thie game this bot offers is pretty much similar to the game of cricket in real life. This bot has been invited to 500+ servers till date and over 2000 players have an account registered in this bot.

<b>NOTE: </b>
This is not the final version of the bot, updates keep coming once a month/week.
